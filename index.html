                <p class="new-item-text"> This one was the perfect read to get into the Halloween season! This book was not at all what I was expecting. Carissa Orlando has such a unique voice and has somehow managed to combine mystery, horror, supernatural/psychological thriller, and humer (of all things!) into one very engageing eerie read.</p>

I actually snagged my copy from my Book of the Month Club subscription and just cracked it open this week! I'm also going through my third re-read of 'A Court of Thorns and Roses' right now, so I will be toggling back and forth between this book and that series.</p>

<h1 class="hello">hello there!</h1>

        <p class="about-me"> Hello! Thank you for stopping by! I've been a lover of books for as long as I can remember, but really got into writing reviews and sharing my opinions on what I read just a few years ago. For some reason, I used to be a bit shy about sharing this information (probably because a lot of my reads fall into the 'smut' category). There was a book I read back in 2019 (the one I'm holding here in the picture) that really took me out of my shell. It reconnected me with all the things I loved about reading. I really just felt like sharing it with whoever would listen, which ultimately resulted in my bookstagram page. Through the bookstagram community, I was able to connect with fellow readers and authors who shared the same passion as I did about all things books. I'm not sure where this webpage will go, but I hope to anchor myself into the book-ish community! Looking forward to sharing my favorite books, quotes and upcoming reads! For the most up to date information, follow my bookstagram account and follow me/friend me on Goodreads! (linked above). Happy Reading!</p>
